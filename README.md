Hello! 

My name is Charlotte Petsche and I live in Arlington, VA. I am currently in my last semester of my MS Data Analytics Engineering Degree, concentration in Predictive Analytics. I currently work at George Mason as the Operations Manager of a faculty supporting office. I have worked on some really cool projects throughout my degree and am excited to showcase them here.
